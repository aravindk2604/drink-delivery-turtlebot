About
=====
This project is about a Turtlebot delivering drinks to people by autonomously navigating in a crowded space. It's one of the many ways to use a Turtlebot by learning to use its sensors, Robot Operating System (`ROS <http://www.ros.org>`_) and coding in general.

This project will target an audience who has some background in Robotics and Computer science concepts. If you would like to get an overview of the Kobuki Turtlebot base (think tank of the robot) then visit this `documentation <https://iclebo-kobuki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ It should help you understand the hardware and the software configs of the robot to an extent.

In this documentation you will understand more on the concepts and methods used to make the Turtlebot deliver drinks to all those thirsty folks out there!

And if it has already piqued your interests in getting a Turtlebot for yourself then visit `Dabit Industries <https://dabit.industries/>`_
