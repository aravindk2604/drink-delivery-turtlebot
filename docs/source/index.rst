Welcome to Drink Delivery Turtlebot's documentation!
====================================================

This project is about a Turtlebot that can deliver drinks to people by moving around carefully in a crowded place. We will make use of its sensors - the Orbbec Astra depth camera, IMU and wheel encoders. We will use an Ultrasonic sensor to let people interact with the Turtlebot and make it move away from them. This is a fun project but it sure packs a lot of technology and intelligence.
